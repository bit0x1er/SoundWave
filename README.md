## üìÇ How It Works

### Static Song Data:
Songs are stored in a JavaScript object like this:

```javascript
const categories = {
  Motivation: [
    {
      title: "Aarambh Hai Prachand X Polozhenie",
      path: "songsimg/Motivation/1.png",
      songpath: "songs/motivational-struggling phase/1.mp3",
    },
    {
      title: "Aarambh Hai Prachand X NF's Hope",
      path: "songsimg/Motivation/2.png",
      songpath: "songs/motivational-struggling phase/2.mp3",
    },
  ],
};
```

### Player Initialization:
When a user selects a category, the relevant songs are dynamically loaded from this object, and their paths are used to play music.

### Static Assets:
All songs and images are pre-stored in the project directory (`songs/`, `img/` and `/songsimg` folders) and referenced directly.
